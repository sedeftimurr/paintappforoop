# 🎨 Python OOP Paint Application

A simple yet feature-rich paint application built using **Python's Tkinter GUI framework**, designed to **demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** such as **Abstraction**, **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.

Created for educational purposes to showcase good software architecture and clean OOP design in a GUI project.

## 📚 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Principle        | Description                                                                                                                                       | File(s)                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Abstraction**   | Common drawing tool interface defined using an abstract base class (`DrawingTool`)                                                              | [`abstract_classes.py`](abstract_classes.py)                             |
| **Encapsulation** | Drawing settings and history are hidden behind controlled interfaces using `@property` and private variables (`_var`)                          | [`settings.py`](settings.py)                                             |
| **Inheritance**   | Drawing tools and the application class itself inherit from base classes to reuse and extend functionality                                     | [`drawing_tools.py`](drawing_tools.py), [`paint_app.py`](paint_app.py)   |
| **Polymorphism**  | Different tools implement the same `draw()` method differently, allowing flexible and interchangeable use                                       | [`drawing_tools.py`](drawing_tools.py)                                   |

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
- `pillow` (for image saving)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pillow

▶️ How to Run
Clone the repository or download the files.

Open terminal in the project directory.

Run the app:

```bash
python paint_app.py

Start drawing on the canvas using various tools and options.

💡 Usage Notes
Press 1–6 to switch between tools (Oval, Square, Star, Line, Circle, Eraser).

Use Ctrl + Z and Ctrl + Y to undo/redo actions.

Use Ctrl + S to save your drawing.

Use Ctrl + N to clear the canvas.
